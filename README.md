# Tree Mapper

A hierarchical note management system with Dendron-like features.

This tool brings hierarchical note management capabilities to your vault, inspired by Dendron. It allows you to organize your notes in a tree-like structure, making it easier to navigate and manage large knowledge bases.

(While Tree Mapper maintains some compatibility with Dendron-structured notes, future compatibility is not guaranteed. It is primarily intended for use with notes in your vault, utilizing a Dendron-like structure)

## Features

- Hierarchical note organization with a tree-like interface
- Easy navigation between related notes
- Create child notes directly from the hierarchy view
- Collapsible note hierarchy for better organization
- Seamless integration with existing features
- Persistent expanded/collapsed state between sessions

## Usage

1. Open the Tree Mapper view from the left sidebar by clicking the folder icon
2. Navigate through your hierarchical notes
3. Click on a note to open it
4. Use the collapse/expand buttons to manage the tree view
5. Create new child notes directly from the hierarchy

## Available Commands
