# Obsidian Another Dendron Plugin

A Dendron-like hierarchical note management plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This plugin brings hierarchical note management capabilities to Obsidian, inspired by Dendron. It allows you to organize your notes in a tree-like structure, making it easier to navigate and manage large knowledge bases.

(While this plugin maintains some compatibility with Dendron-structured notes, future compatibility is not guaranteed. It is primarily intended for use with notes made in Obsidian, utilizing a Dendron-like structure)

## Features

- Hierarchical note organization with a tree-like interface
- Easy navigation between related notes
- Create child notes directly from the hierarchy view
- Collapsible note hierarchy for better organization
- Seamless integration with Obsidian's existing features
- Persistent expanded/collapsed state between sessions

## Usage

1. Open the plugin view from the left sidebar by clicking the folder icon
2. Navigate through your hierarchical notes
3. Click on a note to open it
4. Use the collapse/expand buttons to manage the tree view
5. Create new child notes directly from the hierarchy

## Available Commands

The plugin provides several commands that can be accessed via the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P):

- **Open File Tree View**: Opens the Dendron Tree View in the left sidebar
- **Show File in Dendron Tree View**: Highlights and reveals the current file in the tree view
- **Collapse All Nodes in Dendron Tree**: Collapses all nodes in the tree view
- **Expand All Nodes in Dendron Tree**: Expands all nodes in the tree view

## Internationalization

The plugin supports multiple languages:
